# node-interactivate

[Interactivate][] is an attempt to make traditional [REPL][] based development
more fun and interactive. As of this project it's an offspring of the
[Interactivate][] which attempt to provide more interactive alternative to
node's built-in [REPL].

## Install

    npm install -g node-interactivate

## Usage

Once installed navigate to any project folder and run:

```sh
interactivate
```

In return you'll see message like one below, if you'll navigate there with
your browser you'll enter interactivate shell.

```
Interactivate is running at http://localhost:9000
```

You could also check out this [video demo][] to get an idea how to use this
tool, although note that unlike in the video this project will give you a
node context instead.

## Try

If you'd like to play with interactivate without installing it just go
to the [Interactivate][] page. Note that JS there is executed in browser
context instead of node context, but still it will give you an idea what's
it all about.
